# Marble Gem Collect Simulation

Welcome to the **Marble Gem Collect Simulation** project!

## Description

The **Marble Gem Collect Simulation** is a 3d Unity simulation. The simulation spawns marbles of different styles that compete to collect as many gems as possible during the time frame. There are three "powerups" marbles can which are a size multiplier, gem collection amount multiplier, and speed boost. The marble with the most gems at the end is the winner!
